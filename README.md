idiot video game by unlimited trees, featuring music by RRThiel, A-S-H, Scooblee, CosmicGem, Mr.Sauceman, [c], MiniMacro, Crash, littlelamp100, Woofle,  MegaBaZ, and SoundCirclet (dante)

- made in construct 2
- requires 'sonicphysics' behavior by pixelmonkey and the 'paster' plugin
- i am bad at programming so everything is kind of a mess. also i used a few tutorials for some specific aspects of the game but i forgot which ones lol
